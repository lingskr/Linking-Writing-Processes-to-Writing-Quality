The goal of this competition is to predict overall writing quality. Does typing behavior affect the outcome of an essay? You will develop a model trained on a large dataset of keystroke logs that have captured writing process features.

Your work will help explore the relationship between learnersâ€™ writing behaviors and writing performance, which could provide valuable insights for writing instruction, the development of automated writing evaluation techniques, and intelligent tutoring systems.
